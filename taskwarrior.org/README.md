## task-build

The directory `task-build` was generated by the following steps:

1. update the `task` submodule
2. `mkdir task-build`
3. `cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../ios-cmake-toolchain/iOS.cmake -GXcode -DIOS_PLATFORM=SIMULATOR ../task`

This creates (among other things) `task.xcodeproj` set up only for simulator builds.  It needs to be manually modified to build for simulator and device.

Even though this directory is generated, because of many manual steps that need to be performed to get a functional build, I'm committing this directory.

TODO: Document the manual steps.
